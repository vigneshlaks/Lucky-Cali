## **Theory and Motivation**

The **LLM-Based Strength Training Website** is designed to have a personal learning aspect where users have access to a skill tree and a personalized LLM to help them develop their skills. The Main Vision is expressed below:

- **Personalization**: Providing a more tailored training experience based on user goals and skill levels.
- **Accessible Knowledge**: Democratizing and aggregating the best resources for calisthenics enthusiasts.


I read the book 'the cold start problem'. It made lead me to think more about how the website I was building could be oriented as a "networked product". I eventually came up with the idea of scaling the product in two verticals. Having a competition side where users would compete against eachother and then a LLM centered learning resource. The users would initially be attracted by the learning resource then as the application scales more users would take advantage of the competition aspect. This idea was directly inspired by what I had been reading.
